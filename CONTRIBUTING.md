# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Hieroglyphics Initiative! We are incredibly excited to see how members of our community will use and extend the Hieroglyphics Initiative.
To facilitate your contributions, we've outlined a brief set of guidelines to ensure that your extensions can be easily integrated.

### Communication

Please read through our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
as we expect all our contributors to follow it.

### Git Branches

We adopted the [Gitflow Workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Consequently, the `master` branch corresponds to the latest release of the project, while the `develop` branch corresponds to the most recent, stable, version of the project.

Thus, when adding to the project, **please branch off `develop`** and make sure that your Pull Request (PR) contains the following:
* Detailed description of the changes performed
* Corresponding changes to documentation, unit tests and sample environments (if applicable)
* Summary of the tests performed to validate your changes
* Issue numbers that the PR resolves (if any)

### Style Guide

When performing changes to the codebase, ensure that you follow the style guide of the file you're modifying.
